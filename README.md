## Next steps / Improvements
If I had more time, I would:
- Make the calculator progressive in line with NZ's tax system, so each income range is taxed at its correct portion rather than one flat rate. Example: the first $15,600 at 10.5%, the next $37,900 at 17.5%, etc.
- Improve UI/UX and responsive design ensuring the layout works well on mobile devices.
- Improve error handling to show error messages inside the page rather than alert boxes.
- Write tests for different income levels to make sure the tax is calculated correctly.
